##################

Takes a folder path, finds the .gif files in it, spits out HTML that is more convenient for browsing said .gif files on a mobile device.

Mostly intended as a learning exercise for:

- python
- project documentation with sphinx and reStructuredText
- basic git command-line usage
- Use of an IDE (Eclipse)
